# All C++ Files

These are all C++ programs that I made in my 11th and 12th grade as in my 
Computer Science subject. Contains around 50 C++ files, that i learnt from
basic to advance.

This is the program to find sum of two numbers with a condition that these two numbers must be in range of  0<n<50

INPUT 1

```
INPUT :
Pl enter first no.(0<n<50) :10
Pl enter second no. (0<n<50) :20

OUTPUT:
the sum of 10 and 20 is =30
```

INPUT 2 

```
INPUT:
Pl enter first no.(0<n<50) :10
Pl enter second no. (0<n<50) :60
Pl enter second no. (0<n<50) :45
OUTPUT:
the sum of 10 and 45 is =55


EXPLAINATION : Second Number entered was not in the range
```
