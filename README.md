# All C++ Files

These are all C++ programs that I made in my 11th and 12th grade as in my 
Computer Science subject. Contains around 50 C++ files, that i learnt from
basic to advance.

## All Programs :

### A.cpp

This is the program to find sum of two numbers with a condition that these two numbers must be in range of  0<n<50

INPUT 1

```
INPUT :
Pl enter first no.(0<n<50) :10
Pl enter second no. (0<n<50) :20

OUTPUT:
the sum of 10 and 20 is =30
```

INPUT 2 

```
INPUT:
Pl enter first no.(0<n<50) :10
Pl enter second no. (0<n<50) :60
Pl enter second no. (0<n<50) :45
OUTPUT:
the sum of 10 and 45 is =55


EXPLAINATION : Second Number entered was not in the range
```
### ALLFACTE.CPP

This is the programs to find SUM and PRINT  all  EVEN factors of a given number 

INPUT 1

```
INPUT :

Please enter the value of N :40


OUTPUT :
All factors of 40 are -: 
2
4
8
10
20
40



Sum of all even factors of 40 is ====== 84
```

INPUT 2

```
INPUT:
Please enter the value of N 86


OUTPUT:
All factors of 86 are -: 
2
86


Sum of all even factors of 86 is ====== 88

```

INPUT 3

```
INPUT:
Please enter the value of N 15

OUTPUT:
All factors of 15 are -: 


Sum of all even factors of 15 is ====== 0


EXPLAINATION: THERE IS NO EVEN FACTOR OF THIS NUMBER
```

INPUT 4

```
INPUT:
Please enter the value of N 0

OUTPUT:
All factors of 0 are -: 


Sum of all even factors of 0 is ====== 0
```

### ALLFACTN.CPP

Program to find sum and print all factors of a given number 

input 1

```
INPUT:
Please enter the value of N           -:45


OUTPUT
All factors of 45 are               -:
1
3
5
9
15
45

Sum of all factors of 45 is =====-:78
```



Will be soon adding details about all programs...
